# TheVBAofWallStreet
For this project, I used VBA scipting to analyze real stock market data. <br>
In order to this, I used a For Each loop to loop through the worksheets in the workbook, a nested loop, conditional formatting, and several other functions and commands to demonstrate my VBA skills.<br>
The result looked as follows: <br>
* [VBA Script](VBA_MultiYearChallenge.bas)
* [MultiYearVBAChallengeSheet1(2016)](VBA_MultiYearChallenge_Sheet1 (2016).png)
* [MultiYearVBAChallengeSheet2 (2017)](VBA_MultiYearChallenge_Sheet2 (2015).png)
* [MultiYearVBAChallengeSheet3 (2018)(VBA_MultiYearChallenge_Sheet3 (2014).png)
