# TheVBAofWallStreet
For this project, I used VBA scipting to analyze real stock market data.
In order to this, I used For Each to loop through the worksheets in the workbook, a nested loop, conditional formatting, and several other functions and commands.
The result looked as follows:
    [VBA Script](VBA_MultiYearChallenge.bas)
    [MultiYearChallengeSheet1(2016)] (VBA_MultiYearChallenge_Sheet1 (2016).png)
